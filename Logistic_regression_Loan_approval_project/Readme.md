# Logistic Regression Loan Approval Prediction

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to build a model that predicts whether a loan will be approved or not based on various applicant and loan features.

---

## Project Overview

Loan approval is a critical decision for banks and financial institutions. In this project, we use a supervised classification approach — logistic regression — to predict loan approval status (`Approved` or `Rejected`) from historical loan application data.

## Dataset

- The dataset contains applicant information such as:
  - Credit history
  - Income
  - Loan amount
  - Property area
  - Employment status
  - Other financial details

- Data source: [Kaggle]

## Approach

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
   Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features if necessary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   Analyze feature distributions, correlations, and visualize key insights.

3. **Model Building:**  
   Implement logistic regression using Scikit-learn to classify loan approval.

4. **Model Evaluation:**  
   Evaluate model performance using metrics such as:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision, Recall
   - F1-Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC-AUC curve
